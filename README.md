<h2>The Home Screen</h2>
The Home screen provides a main menu for accessing the App modules.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Clicking on a witness allows the user to take a witness statement.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The Immediate Action tab allows for the capture of what was done immediately after the H&amp;S Incident…

<a href="https://github.com/delordson/HealthAndSafety/blob/master/Resources/screenshot_05112014_113750.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2004" alt="screenshot_05112014_113750" src="https://github.com/delordson/HealthAndSafety/blob/master/Resources/screenshot_05112014_113750.png" width="700" height="393" /></a>

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

…and the Additional Comment tab allows for the capture of any further information related to the incident.

<a href="https://github.com/delordson/HealthAndSafety/blob/master/Resources/screenshot_05112014_113753.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2005" alt="screenshot_05112014_113753" src="https://github.com/delordson/HealthAndSafety/blob/master/Resources/screenshot_05112014_113753.png" width="700" height="393" /></a>

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Finally if the logged in user is the one the H&amp;S Incident is reported to, the will see an Investigation tab. This is the place where the outcome of the investigation is recorded. Details recorded include Root Cause of the Incident and the Preventative Action required to stop a recurrence.

<a href="https://github.com/delordson/HealthAndSafety/blob/master/Resources/screenshot_05112014_113757.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2006" alt="screenshot_05112014_113757" src="https://github.com/delordson/HealthAndSafety/blob/master/Resources/screenshot_05112014_113757.png" width="700" height="393" /></a>

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Of course the built in LightSwitch validation of required fields and field lengths works great as expected…

<a href="https://github.com/delordson/HealthAndSafety/blob/master/Resources/screenshot_05112014_113642.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1998" alt="screenshot_05112014_113642" src="https://github.com/delordson/HealthAndSafety/blob/master/Resources/screenshot_05112014_113642.png" width="700" height="393" /></a>

&nbsp;

…but we’ve also added business logic where it makes sense.
